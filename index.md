## Brief Introduction  

I'm a San Diego based programmer that currently studies Computer Science at University Of California San Diego (UCSD)  For the most part I was raised in Mexico and speak fluently English and Spanish. I enjoy playing [video games](#games), 3D printing and thinkering with Arduinos every now and then.

###### If you are interested my 3D printer is a [Creality Ender 3](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/creality-ender-3-pro-3d-printer), an ***affordable*** starter printer

My inspiration for programming maninly sparks due to my desire to automate tasks, and the following pictures illustrates my sentiment:

## Games  
Some of my favorite games, in no particular order, are:

* Nier Automata
* Metal Gear Solid V
* Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War

With one of my favorite quotes being by Kaz:

> Why are we still here? Just to suffer?


Some of the games that I want to beat are:  

- [x] Diablo 3
- [ ] Middle Earth Shadow of War
- [x] Portal 2

## Coding

I have  4 years of coding experience, which spans maninly Python, Java and C++. Python is my favorite language since it has a lot of utility built in and ready to go that allows you to do one liners rather fast, an example being:

` a in b `

Which does what we expect due to our intuition, of course the tradeoffs become more noticeable the more complex we get, but it still is a formidable language.

There are plenty of languages out there, but I feel that I know enough to pick up almost any high level languages within a good amount of time.

In a  future I'll add some of my personal projects [here](./projects.md) , including pictures of my 3D prints
